This python script defines a function called delete_workflow which takes in two parameters: data and args. The data parameter is the output from the upstream parent block (if applicable) and the args parameter is the output from any additional upstream blocks. The function then sets the instanceId, customer_name, and full_workflow_name variables based on the data parameter. It then creates a header_staple dictionary and a delete_workflow_url string. The function then makes a delete request to the delete_workflow_url and checks the status code of the response. If the status code is 200, it prints a success message and returns the data parameter. If the status code is 504, 503, 502, or 500, it prints the response and prints an error message before returning the data parameter. If the status code is anything else, it prints the response and prints an error message before returning the data parameter.
