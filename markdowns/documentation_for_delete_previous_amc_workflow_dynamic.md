This python script creates a workflow in Amazon Advertising API. It takes in a dictionary of data, which includes the access token, instanceId, customer name, full workflow name, and sql query. It then creates a header staple with the necessary information for the request. It then creates a post request with the workflowId, sqlQuery, and inputParameters. If the request is successful, it will log a success message. If the request fails, it will log a warning message and retry. If the request returns a 400 status code, it will log an info message and continue. The test output function is used to test the output of the block. It will assert that the output is not None.
