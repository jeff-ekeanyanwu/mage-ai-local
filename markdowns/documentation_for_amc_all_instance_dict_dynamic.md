This python script is used to load data from an API. It takes in an access token, data_2, and optional arguments and keyword arguments as inputs. It returns a list of dictionaries containing customer name, instanceId, sql query, query name, and access token as outputs. 

The script begins by importing necessary libraries and decorators. It then defines a function called load_data_from_api which takes in the access token, data_2, and optional arguments and keyword arguments as inputs. It sets up the header staple for the request and creates empty lists for customerName, apiEndpoint, instanceId, and amc_dict. It then iterates through the instances in the data and appends the customer name, apiEndpoint, and instanceId to the respective lists. It then creates a dictionary containing the customer name, instanceId, sql query, query name, and access token and appends it to the list of instances info. Finally, it returns the list of dictionaries. 

The script also defines a test function called test_output which takes in the output and optional arguments as inputs. It then asserts that the output is not None.
