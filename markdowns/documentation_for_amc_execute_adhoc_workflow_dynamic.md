This python script is used to retrieve the status of a workflow execution from the Amazon Advertising API. It takes in the output from the upstream parent block (if applicable) and any additional upstream blocks as arguments. It then sets up the header staple for the request and creates a URL for the request. It then checks the status of the workflow execution and if it is still running or pending, it will wait for 200 seconds before checking again. If the workflow is cancelled, it will raise an exception and if it is successful, it will download the URL and read the CSV file into a data frame. Finally, it will return the data frame.
