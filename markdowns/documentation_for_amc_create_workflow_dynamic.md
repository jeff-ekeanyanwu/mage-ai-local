This python script is used to create a workflow for Amazon Advertising API. It takes in a dictionary of data as an argument, which includes the access token, instance ID, customer name, full workflow name, and SQL query. It then creates a header staple with the necessary information for the API request. The script then creates a POST request to the workflows URL with the post data containing the workflow ID, SQL query, and input parameters. If the status code of the request is 200, it prints a message that the workflow creation failed and retries. If the status code is in the range of 504, 503, 502, 500, or 400, it prints the JSON response and raises an exception. Finally, the script has a test output function to test the output of the block.
