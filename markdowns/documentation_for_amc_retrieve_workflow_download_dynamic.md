This python script implements a transformer action to remove rows from a given DataFrame. The action is built using the build_transformer_action function, which takes in the DataFrame, the action type (in this case, ActionType.FILTER), the axis (Axis.ROW) and the action code (entity_id != null). The action is then executed using the BaseAction class, which takes in the action as an argument. The execute function is then called on the BaseAction object, which takes in the DataFrame as an argument and returns the finished DataFrame.
