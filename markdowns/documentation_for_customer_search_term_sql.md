This python script defines a function called customer_search_term() which creates a SQL query and query name. The SQL query is used to select distinct entity_id, campaign, ad_product_type, placement_type, customer_search_term, traffic_event_date as event_date, count(distinct user_id) as search_users, sum(total_purchases) as purchases, count(distinct case when total_purchases > 0 then user_id end) as purchase_users, sum(case when new_to_brand = true then total_purchases else 0 end) as ntb_purchases, and count(distinct case when new_to_brand = true and total_purchases > 0 then user_id end) as ntb_purchase_users from the amazon_attributed_events_by_traffic_time table. The query also groups the results by campaign, placement_type, customer_search_term, event_date, ad_product_type, and entity_id. The query name is set to "customer_search_term_sa". The function returns a list containing the SQL query
