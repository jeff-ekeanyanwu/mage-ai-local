This python script defines a function called `get_access_token()` which is used to retrieve an access token from a yaml file. The function first reads the yaml file located at the path `/home/src/default_repo/secrets/secrets.yaml` and stores the data in the variable `settings_data`. It then stores the `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` from the yaml file in the variables `p_refresh_token`, `p_client_id`, and `p_client_secret` respectively. 

The function then makes a POST request to the `token_auth_url` with the `post_objects` containing the `grant_type`, `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` as parameters. The response is stored in the variable `r` and is converted to a json formatted string and stored in the variable `json_formatted_str`. Finally, the access token is retrieved from the response and stored in the variable `access_token` which is then returned by the function. 

The script also defines a test function called `test_
