This python script is used to export data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The data is stored in a DataFrame object and is exported to the bucket using the GoogleCloudStorage class. The configuration settings for the Google Cloud Storage bucket are specified in the 'io_config.yaml' file. The bucket name and object key are specified in the script. The object key is generated using the customer name, query start date, and query end date. If the DataFrame is empty, a message is printed to the console.
